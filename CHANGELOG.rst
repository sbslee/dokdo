Changelog
*********

1.17.0 (in development)
-----------------------

* :issue:`53`: Fix bug in :meth:`taxa_abundance_bar_plot`, :meth:`taxa_abundance_box_plot`, :meth:`pname` methods when taxa names don't have any prefix (e.g. ``k__`` in ``k__Bacteria``). This can occur if taxonomic classification was performed with databases other than, say, Greengenes and SILVA.

1.16.0 (2022-12-27)
-------------------

* Add new argument ``palette`` to :meth:`taxa_abundance_box_plot` method.
* :issue:`51`: Fix bug in :meth:`clustermap` method where color labels disappeared when ``flip=True``.

1.15.0 (2022-08-23)
-------------------

* Update :meth:`pname` method to support taxa names that don't have a delimiter such as ASV IDs (e.g. ``1ad289cd8f44e109fd95de0382c5b252``). Basically, the method will simply return the input name as is.
* Add new argument ``delimiter`` to :meth:`pname` method.
* Add new method :meth:`group_correlation_heatmap`.

1.14.0 (2022-06-24)
-------------------

* :issue:`39`: Add new argument ``palette`` to :meth:`beta_2d_plot` and :meth:`beta_3d_plot` methods so that users can control categorical color mapping.
* :issue:`39`: Bring back ``add_datapoints`` argument to :meth:`taxa_abundance_box_plot` method to display data points on top of the boxes (note that it was deprecated in 1.11.0 version).
* Add new argument ``kwargs`` to :meth:`beta_2d_plot` method. It will be passed to :meth:`seaborn.scatterplot()` method so that users can have more control over various aspects of the output plot.
* :issue:`41`: Fix bug in :meth:`beta_parallel_plot` method when users provide the ``ax`` argument.

1.13.0 (2022-04-02)
-------------------

* :issue:`37`: Add new methods :meth:`cross_association_table`, :meth:`cross_association_heatmap`, and :meth:`cross_association_regplot`.

1.12.0 (2022-02-11)
-------------------

* :issue:`33`: Update the :command:`make-manifest` command to ignore undetermined FASTQ files.
* :issue:`34`: Update the :meth:`alpha_rarefaction_plot` method to keep 'N/A' values as string instead of NaN.
* :issue:`35`: Update the methods :meth:`alpha_diversity_plot`, :meth:`beta_2d_plot`, and :meth:`beta_3d_plot` to accept :class:`pandas.DataFrame` in case the input data was not generated from QIIME 2 (e.g. shotgun sequencing).
* Update the methods :meth:`beta_2d_plot` and :meth:`beta_3d_plot` to print out the proportions explained instead of embedding them in the PCoA plot.

1.11.0 (2021-08-04)
-------------------

* :issue:`21`: Update the :meth:`taxa_abundance_bar_plot` method to accept :class:`pandas.DataFrame` in case the input data was not generated from QIIME 2 (e.g. shotgun sequencing).
* :issue:`19`: Remove the ``artist_kwargs`` argument from all the remaining methods:

  - :meth:`denoising_stats_plot`
  - :meth:`alpha_rarefaction_plot`
  - :meth:`alpha_diversity_plot`
  - :meth:`beta_2d_plot`

* :issue:`22`: Rename the :meth:`heatmap` method to :meth:`clustermap`.
* :issue:`22`: Update the :meth:`clustermap` method to accept :class:`pandas.DataFrame` in case the input data was not generated from QIIME 2 (e.g. shotgun sequencing). You can now also flip the x and y axes with the ``flip`` option.
* :issue:`22`: Add a new main plotting method :meth:`heatmap`.
* :issue:`24`: Update the :meth:`pname` method to allow returning of more than one tax level.
* Deprecate the ``add_datapoints`` argument in the :meth:`taxa_abundance_box_plot` method.

1.10.0 (2021-07-06)
-------------------

* :issue:`14`, :issue:`17`: Add the ``group_order`` option to the :meth:`taxa_abundance_bar_plot` method.
* Fix a minor bug in the :meth:`addbiplot` method when feature is 'Unassigned'.

1.9.0 (2021-06-07)
------------------

* Add publicly available datasets from QIIME 2 for tutorials.
* :issue:`14`: Add the ``group`` option to the :meth:`taxa_abundance_bar_plot` method. Using this option will create a bar for each group instead of each sample.

1.8.0 (2021-05-09)
------------------

* Updated docstring.
* Moved the official documentation from Wiki page to Read the Docs.

1.7.0 (2021-04-05)
------------------

- Added a new command called ``count-reads`` which counts the number of sequence reads from FASTQ.
- Updated the ``summarize`` command.
- Updated the following methods:

    - ``taxa_abundance_box_plot()``
    - ``taxa_abundance_bar_plot()``
    - ``distance_matrix_plot()``
    - ``ordinate()``

1.6.0 (2021-03-08)
------------------

- Added a new method called ``pname()`` which returns a prettified taxon name.
